Initially, the NixOS operating system was considered and downloaded onto the laptop of one of the group members. Subsequently, Rufus was used to convert it into a bootable SD card. The card was then inserted into a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC, and it was booted. The network configuration has been started and, since it is a declarative system, some packages have been downloaded including: vim, lwd, git, openssh, gcc, bat, calc, bc, dox2unix, feh, file, lsd, nixpkgs-fat, nix-output-nonltor, nix-prefetch-github.
During the installation of samba, to ensure communication and collaboration between the network, an error occurred: "a 'x86_64-linux' with features {} is required to build '/nix/store/58fz02g4p6f3y177nwfkwyqmzzmcm1r0-builder.pl .drv', but I am a 'aarch64-linux' with features {benchmark, big-parallel, gccarch-armv8-a, kvm, nixos-test}". Two approaches were attempted to try to resolve the generated error. We tried to roll back the system a few generations back, but since this didn't work and the error was not resolved, it was considered to clean the system of some dependencies. Unfortunately, some of the dependencies that were eliminated were still needed, so at that point, the group had to decide what to do next. Considering the progress achieved so far, the time remaining, and the difficulty of the operating system, it was decided to use a different one. The systems considered were two imperatives: Debian and Ubuntu; the final choice fell on the Debian derivative system, Ubuntu.

UBUNTU 20.04.6 LTS (focal) was chosen as it has long-term support and supports PXE. The image and the installer were downloaded and deployed in the Raspberry Pi 4 SBC, and the network was configured.
Since it is necessary to create a computer cluster, it was necessary to create a remote directory with all the operating system information accessible to other devices to retrieve information for system deployment.

Error PXE-E21 was encountered in the deployment process. PXE-E21 error during a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) boot process may indicate an issue with the inability of the remote boot ROM to properly communicate with the PXE server, resulting in issues with downloading the boot file from the PXE server to the client computer. The causes could be network problems, configuration errors, Firewall, boot file or DHCP server problems. To try to resolve the error, we checked the network connectivity, verified that the boot file existed on the PXE server and was accessible, confirmed that the DHCP server was configured correctly, and checked the PXE server configuration for any errors. Network security settings were examined to ensure the required ports were not blocked when the "temporary failure resolving 'ports.ubuntu.com'" error was encountered.
After this error, connecting the head node to the network was no longer possible.
The "temporary failure resolving 'ports.ubuntu.com'" error can occur when the system cannot resolve the domain name "ports.ubuntu.com" to an IP address via DNS. This happened because DNS configuration problems arose where the 8.8.8.8 IP address was permanently altered at every attempt to restart the PXE process. The contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` were checked, but the DNS server entries were correct.
